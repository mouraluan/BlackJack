# Java Blackjack Project
This project, developed during the [Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-java-development-bootcamp/) by Professor Rayan Slim at Learn The Part Inc., is a console-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack.

### Project Description
The Java Blackjack project simulates the popular game where the player competes against a computerized dealer to achieve a card score close to 21 without exceeding it.

### Key Features
-  Interactive Gameplay: The game prompts the user to make decisions such as "hit" (draw another card) or "stay" (keep the current hand).

- Card Visualization: The project includes a visual representation of the cards using ASCII art, enhancing the user interface.

- Winning Logic: Implements the core logic of Blackjack, determining win/loss conditions and handling the dealer's actions.
